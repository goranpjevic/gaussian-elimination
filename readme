                              gaussian-elimination

solve systems of linear equations using gaussian elimination.

note:

128 bit floating point numbers are used by default.

to use 64 bit floating point numbers, change the third line to:

  ⎕fr←645

the first line in the input file contains the number of equations to solve.
the following lines contain numbers separated by spaces, representing the
matrix to be solved.

example input file:

3
1 1 2 6
0 2 1 4
3 1 0 4

usage:

  ge.apl [input_file]
